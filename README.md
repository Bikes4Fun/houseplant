# houseplant
Arduino and Raspberry Pi powered smart home houseplant watering system.

Intended to provide automated watering, button press watering,
and wifi based anywhere watering as well as compatiblity with Apple Home 

I am very new to arduino, and I don't have all of the equipment - this code has not be tested. 
This is concept code that will be completed, validated and tested when the equipment is present.
